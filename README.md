# 🥗 Adaptive Meal Planner using RAG & Google Gemini

An intelligent, AI-powered **Adaptive Meal Planner** that leverages **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to generate personalized meal plans based on user-uploaded **Medical Health Reports**. The system intelligently adapts dietary recommendations to individual health conditions using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and efficient semantic search embeddings.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **Medical Report Analysis**  
  Upload your health reports (PDF, text) and extract meaningful data to guide dietary planning.

- 🤖 **LLM Integration with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**  
  Uses a powerful LLM to generate health-conscious, context-aware responses and recommendations.

- 🔍 **RAG Architecture**  
  Combines vector-based retrieval with generative reasoning for accurate, personalized output.

- 🧠 **Embeddings with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**  
  Lightweight, fast, and highly effective model for sentence-level semantic understanding and retrieval.

- 🥗 **Custom Meal Plans**  
  Generates adaptive meal suggestions considering conditions like:
  - Diabetes
  - High/Low Blood Pressure
  - Obesity/Underweight
  - Cholesterol
  - Nutrient deficiencies
